Technical Description of Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
Introduction
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a fundamental component of modern data management. It is a software program that stores data in a structured format using rows and columns, making it easy to organize, manage, and retrieve information efficiently. An RDBMS is used to manage and interact with databases based on the relational model, introduced by E.F. Codd in 1970. This model organizes data into tables, which consist of rows (records) and columns (fields). Multiple tables are created to form a database, and these tables are related to each other directly or indirectly. This structure helps connect all the data in the database. RDBMSs are designed to handle large volumes of data, allowing for quick access and manipulation. Tables are the fundamental building blocks of an RDBMS. Each table represents a specific entity or category of data. For instance, a table named Customers might store data about customers, including their names, addresses, and phone numbers. Each column in a table represents a specific attribute of the entity. For example, the Customers table might have columns for CustomerID, Name, Address, and PhoneNumber. Each row in a table represents a single record, such as a row in the Customers table containing the data for a single customer.
HOW is RDBMS actually MANAGED
In an RDBMS, data is stored in tables that can be related to each other using primary and foreign keys. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring that each record can be uniquely identified. For instance, CustomerID could be the primary key for the Customers table, ensuring that no two customers have the same ID. A foreign key is a field in one table that is used to link it to another table. It creates a connection between the two tables by referring to the primary key of the other table. For example, in an Orders table, there might be a column called CustomerID. This CustomerID is a foreign key that links to the CustomerID in the Customers table. This link helps the database understand which customer placed which order, making it easier to establish relationships between 2 or more tables. Primary keys and foreign keys are very crucial in RDBMS because they maintain the integrity of the databases. By having these keys properly set up, the database becomes reliable and robust. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. For instance, if we make CustomerID the primary key in the Customers table, the RDBMS will ensure that no two customers can have the same CustomerID. This guarantees that each customer has a unique identifier, making it easy to search and retrieve data. Similarly, a foreign key is used to link tables together. It is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. For example, in the Orders table, CustomerID can be set as a foreign key. If CustomerID #3 has placed an order in the Orders table, this foreign key will point to CustomerID #3 in the Customers table, ensuring that the order is associated with the correct customer. This means that CustomerID #3 in the Orders table will always correspond to a single customer, such as John, whose CustomerID is #3 in the Customers table. This relationship helps maintain accurate and consistent data across the database. So the databases are designed by keeping in mind all the necessary keys and their relationships. Apart from this, there are several other important considerations while designing a database. These include normalization, which involves organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity; selecting appropriate data types to ensure efficient storage and accurate representation; creating indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval; implementing constraints such as UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK to enforce data rules; ensuring transactions are properly managed to maintain consistency; and defining security measures, such as access controls and user permissions, to protect the data. These factors collectively contribute to a well-structured, efficient, and secure database system.
